# WordPress

If you want to use PurgeCSS with WordPress, you might need to safelist classes generated by WordPress to avoid them being removed by PurgeCSS. `purgecss-with-wordpress` contains the classes needed to be safelisted.

## Installation

You need to install [purgecss](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss) first.

Install `purgecss-with-wordpress`:
```sh
npm i --save-dev purgecss-with-wordpress
```

## Usage

```js{2,7,8}
import Purgecss from 'purgecss'
import purgecssWordpress from 'purgecss-with-wordpress'

const purgeCss = new Purgecss({
  content: ['**/*.html'],
  css: ['**/*.css'],
  safelist: purgecssWordpress.safelist
})
const result = purgecss.purge()
```

If you have additional classes you want to include, you can include them using the spread operator:

```js
{
  safelist: [
    ...purgecssWordpress.safelist,
    'red',
    'blue',
    /^red/,
    /blue$/,
  ]
}
```
